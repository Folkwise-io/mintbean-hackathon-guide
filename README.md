Code Of Conduct <a id="CodeOfConduct"></a>
--------------------------------------------


Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at a MintBean Event, if interacting with a MintBean representative or Code Mentor makes you uncomfortable, please report it to Jennifer Tang or another MintBean representative.

MintBean stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

MintBean staff & Mentors also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MintBean may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Jennifer Tang or any other MintBean representative.

Plagiarism in coding is a bit different; copy and pasting are very common and not discouraged. So we ask that you only use code that you can explain on a high level(basic gist). Any code that is essential to the core functionality that you didn't write or If you used someone elses code as the base of your project you must give them credit(linked in some way) npm packages are already credited in the package.json.

If the base of your project was written by someone else you must make at least 2 meaningful changes to the project. MORE THAN STYLING.

All Announcements will be posted on our discord channel

### Say Hello!

Mintbean is an online community of software developers interested in perfecting their craft. Our virtual hackathons and online unconferences are a fast-paced and fun way to keep your skills sharp. They help you impress potential employers, learn new technologies, grow your skillset, build your portfolio, and create new and lasting connections.

#### Welcome to the community,

Head on over to the #introduce-yourself channel and say hello.

### Participate

On our [Website](https://mintbean.io/) a you can find a list of upcoming hackathons and events, These can also be found on our [Eventbrite.](https://www.eventbrite.ca/o/mintbean-28752300031)

### Have A question

Each event will have its own channel where you can ask questions. Assigned code mentors monitor these channels, but make sure to tag them, so they are alerted when you ask a question. There is also a #question channel where you can put a query in front of the entire community. If you were looking for a specific person to respond, please remember to tag them. If you're asking a technical question, there is a handy guide below to help you provide all the information that might be needed to prepare the code mentors and the community to help you.

### Don't let your hard work go to waste!

Make Sure You Submit! Judging begins at 11:30AM EST on Wednesday for the Monday event and Friday for the Wednesday Event. So make sure your project has been submitted by that time. If we receive less than five submissions, no winners will be announced, but the judges will provide feedback and recommendations if you wish to further develop your application.

### Most Importantly Have Fun!!!

Don't let the struggle get you down! We have all been there. If you get stuck, "you're in luck, 'cause up your sleeves / You got a brand of magic, never fails / You've got some power in your corner now / Some heavy ammunition in your camp / You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo and how?" - Genie(Robin Williams). See, all you gotta do is ask. The community is here to back you up and help you through your snags. If you ever feel like you don't belong, just look at the photo of what a developer looks like.You are a developer, and you definitely belong here we all started at different places and learn at different paces. Try to focus on your improvement and not on others. It may take time, but you can do anything you set your mind to.

FAQ <a id="FAQ"></a>
----------------------


* How do I plan?

  * Idea

    Ask your self these questions

    * What is the prompt/theme?
    * What problem do I want to solve?
    * What already exists that I wish was better?
    * Can I accomplish this in the given time? (Yes/No/Maybe)
    * Can I build part of this in the given time? (MVP)

    If you can take your grand idea and create a lite version of it, that is fine. The end of the hackathon doesn't mean the end of the project, we may ask you to start with a blank slate, but you can always keep going.
  * Minimum Viable Product(MVP)

    The bare bones of your idea, nothing fancy the most basic features your app needs to have. Think of building a house; this is your foundation, no walls, doors, rooms, or windows. It is the first thing you have to do before you can do anything else, and make sure it is done well a weak foundation makes for a poor house.
  * Wire Frame

    If it looks like it was drawn by a five-year-old, it is probably good enough. It doesn't have to be on a fancy tool/app, pen and paper will do just fine; it is a rough outline for the layout of your app. Where everything will go when you finally build it, not its color or shape, just a general idea of where.
  * Iterate

    Start with the foundation; you can't build a house roof first, slowly add to it, and make sure that everything is done well. Bugs can cause the whole thing to collapse; having more features is less important than having good, well-made ones. Something half done is better than something done half-ass.
  * Review

    Before moving on to building the next part of your app, take a second to look at what you got. Are there any Bugs? Do they need to be fixed? Is there anything that I can do better? Is it so easy to use that even a Neanderthal can use it? Not every bug needs to be fixed right now, due to the time constraint create a reminder, and come back to it later. Focus on only fixing bugs that would regularly impact the user, i.e., error messages that don't go away, graphics that are conditional showing when their condition is false, or any app breaking bugs.
* How do I submit?

  Navigate to provided submission URL
* Q: How much does it cost?

  A: It's absolutely free!
* Q: Where can I see updates during the event?

  A: Updates will be announced in the MintBean Discord Channel
* Q: Who Can Hack?

  A: Front End Developers, Full Stack Developers, Self Learners, Job Seekers, and Anyone who wants to code!
* Q: What if I’ve never been to a hackathon before?/ What Should I Know?

  A: We suggest that you know the basics/fundamentals of the language you're coding in and the basics of git and GitHub. We are here to help you expand on what you already know.
* Q: Any other questions?

  A: Reach out to a code mentor, in #questions channel on discord or code mentor and event organizers on HopIn.

Are you Stuck? Need help... How to ask a Technical Question! <a id="Question"></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### In plain non-technical english, describe the problem you have encountered.

The button is the wrong color.

### In plain non-technical english, describe the expected behavior.

The button is red.

### In plain non-technical english, describe the actual behavior.

The button is blue.

### Post any code you think might be relevant. Use fenced backticks ``` with a language specified.

```javascript
// src/scripts/button.js
console.log("I am inside button.js");
```

```css
\* src/styles/style.css \*/
\* { color: red; }
div.button { color: blue; }
```

```html
<button class="button">
 Button
</button>
```

### If you see an error message, post it here (including the full error log). If you don’t, what unexpected behavior are you seeing?

```bash
Uncaught Error: Sample error
   at someMethod (repl:1:27)
   at someMethod (repl:20:22)
   at someMethod (repl:30:20)
   at someMethod (repl:101:7)
```

### What is your best guess as to the source of the problem?

I don't know, but I think the CSS is off. Maybe it's in the JS.

### What things have you already tried to solve the problem?

I've tried playing with the CSS and with the JS.

We have some ready to go LinkedIn Templates that you can use

[Show and Tell](https://blog.mintbean.io/mintbean-hackathon-guide-linkedin-templates/)

Does you App have issues? Does someone elses app have issues? Let's QA! <a name="Issue"></a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Creating an issue for your self

##### Expected Behavior

Describe the desired behavior

I wanted the button to be red

##### Actual Behavior

Describe actual behavior

The button is blue

##### How to Resolve

Describe How to Fix

use more specific CSS selectors to make sure style is applied

Come back later to fix it if you have time or after the hackathon

### Creating an issue for someone else

##### Describe the User Flow

How Did you interact with the site

I was on my profile page and wanted to navigate to a friend page, but there was no indication of how to do that.

##### Problematic Behavior

Describe What Happened

I eventually figured out that by clicking on her photo took me to her page, but there wasn't anything to show that her phot0 was clickable.

##### Ideas for Improvement (optional Must be actionable and kind)

List any ideas you have that might fix it

Changing the cursor or maybe providing some sort of tooltip would be helpful.
