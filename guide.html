      h2 Our Mission
      p
        | Mintbean is an online community of software developers interested in
        | perfecting their craft. Our virtual hackathons and online unconferences
        | are a fast-paced and fun way to keep sharp. They help you impress
        | potential employers, learn new technologies, grow your skill set,
        | build your portfolio, and create new connections.
      h2 Code Of Conduct
      p
        | Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a
        | situation that makes you uncomfortable at a MintBean Event, if
        | interacting with a MintBean representative or Code Mentor makes you
        | uncomfortable, please report it to Jennifer Tang or another MintBean
        | representative.
      p
        | MintBean stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has
        | the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
      p
        | Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written
        | comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability,
        | physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic
        | status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation,
        | stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
        | disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. If
        | what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as
        | harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
      p
        | Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        | immediately.
      p
        | MintBean staff & Mentors also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
        | particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or
        | other material both in their hacks and during the event.
      p
        | If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MintBean may take any
        | action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
        | from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
        | being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Jennifer Tang
        | or any other MintBean representative.
      p
        | Plagiarism in coding is a bit different; copy and pasting are very
        | common and not discouraged. So we ask that you only use code that you
        | can explain on a high level(basic gist).
