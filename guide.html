  h2 Code Of Conduct
  p
    | Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a
    | situation that makes you uncomfortable at a MintBean Event, if
    | interacting with a MintBean representative or Code Mentor makes you
    | uncomfortable, please report it to Jennifer Tang or another MintBean
    | representative.
  p
    | MintBean stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has
    | the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
  p
    | Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written
    | comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability,
    | physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic
    | status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation,
    | stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
    | disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. If
    | what you&rsquo;re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as
    | harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
  p
    | Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
    | immediately.
  p
    | MintBean staff &amp; Mentors also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
    | particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or
    | other material both in their hacks and during the event.
  p
    | If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MintBean may take any
    | action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
    | from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
    | being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Jennifer Tang
    | or any other MintBean representative.
  p
    | Plagiarism in coding is a bit different; copy and pasting are very
    | common and not discouraged. So we ask that you only use code that you
    | can explain on a high level(basic gist). Any code that is essential to
    | the core functionality that you didn&apos;t write or If you used someone
    | elses code as the base of your project you must give them credit(linked
    | in some way) npm packages are already credited in the package.json.
  p
    | If the base of your project was written by someone else you must make at least 2 meaningful changes to the project. MORE THAN STYLING.

    | are a fast-paced and fun way to keep your skills sharp. They help you
    | impress potential employers, learn new technologies, grow your skillset,
    | build your portfolio, and create new and lasting connections.

  h3 Have A question
  p
    | Each event will have its own channel where you can ask questions.
    | Assigned code mentors monitor these channels, but make sure to tag them,
    | so they are alerted when you ask a question. There is also a #question
    | channel where you can put a query in front of the entire community. If
    | you were looking for a specific person to respond, please remember to
    | tag them. If you&apos;re asking a technical question, there is a handy guide
    | below to help you provide all the information that might be needed to
    | prepare the code mentors and the community to help you.

            li Can I build part of this in the given time? (MVP)
          p
            | If you can take your grand idea and create a lite version of it,
            | that is fine. The end of the hackathon doesn&apos;t mean the end of
            | the project, we may ask you to start with a blank slate, but you
            | can always keep going.
        li
          p Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
          p
            | The bare bones of your idea, nothing fancy the most basic
            | features your app needs to have. Think of building a house; this
            | is your foundation, no walls, doors, rooms, or windows. It is
            | the first thing you have to do before you can do anything else,
            | and make sure it is done well a weak foundation makes for a poor
            | house.
        li
          p Wire Frame
          p
            | If it looks like it was drawn by a five-year-old, it is probably
            | good enough. It doesn&apos;t have to be on a fancy tool/app, pen and
            | paper will do just fine; it is a rough outline for the layout of
            | your app. Where everything will go when you finally build it,
            | not its color or shape, just a general idea of where.
        li
          p Iterate
          p
            | Start with the foundation; you can&apos;t build a house roof first,
            | slowly add to it, and make sure that everything is done well.
            | Bugs can cause the whole thing to collapse; having more features
            | is less important than having good, well-made ones. Something
            | half done is better than something done half-ass.
        li
          p Review
          p
            | Before moving on to building the next part of your app, take a
            | second to look at what you got. Are there any Bugs? Do they need
            | to be fixed? Is there anything that I can do better? Is it so
            | easy to use that even a Neanderthal can use it? Not every bug
            | needs to be fixed right now, due to the time constraint create a
            | reminder, and come back to it later. Focus on only fixing bugs
            | that would regularly impact the user, i.e., error messages that
            | don&apos;t go away, graphics that are conditional showing when their
            | condition is false, or any app breaking bugs.

  h3 What is your best guess as to the source of the problem?
