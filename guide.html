      h2 Code Of Conduct
      p
        | Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a
        | situation that makes you uncomfortable at a MintBean Event, if
        | interacting with a MintBean representative or Code Mentor makes you
        | uncomfortable, please report it to Jennifer Tang or another MintBean
        | representative.
      p
        | MintBean stands for inclusivity. We believe that every single person has
        | the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.
      p
        | Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written
        | comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability,
        | physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic
        | status, veteran status, sexual images, deliberate intimidation,
        | stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
        | disruption of talks or other events, and unwelcome sexual attention. If
        | what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as
        | harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.
      p
        | Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
        | immediately.
      p
        | MintBean staff & Mentors also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
        | particular, attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or
        | other material both in their hacks and during the event.
      p
        | If a participant engages in harassing behavior, MintBean may take any
        | action it deems appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion
        | from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
        | being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Jennifer Tang
        | or any other MintBean representative.
      p
        | Plagiarism in coding is a bit different; copy and pasting are very
        | common and not discouraged. So we ask that you only use code that you
        | can explain on a high level(basic gist).

        | Assigned code mentors, monitor these channels, but make sure to tag them

        | channel where you can put a question in front of the entire community,
        | if you were looking for a specific person's to respond please remember
        | to tag them. If you're asking a technical question there is a handy
        | guide below to help you provide all the information that might be needed
        | to help the code mentors and the community help you.

                | If you can take your grand idea and create a lite version of it,
                | that is fine. The end of the hackathon doesn't mean the end of
                | the project, we may ask you to start with a blank slate, but you
                | can always keep going.

                | The bare bones of your idea, nothing fancy the most basic
                | features your app needs to have. Think of building a house; this
                | is your foundation, no walls, doors, rooms, or windows. It is
                | the first thing you have to do before you can do anything else,
                | and make sure it is done well a weak foundation makes for a poor
                | house.

              p
                | If it looks like it was drawn by a five-year-old, it is probably
                | good enough. It doesn't have to be on a fancy tool/app, pen and
                | paper will do just fine; it is a rough outline for the layout of
                | your app. Where everything will go when you finally build it,
                | not its color or shape, just a general idea of where.

              p Iterate
              p
                | Start with the foundation; you can't build a house roof first,
                | slowly add to it, and make sure that everything is done well.
                | Bugs can cause the whole thing to collapse; having more features
                | is less important than having good, well-made ones. Something
                | half done is better than something done half-ass.

              p Review
              p
                | Before moving on to building the next part of your app, take a
                | second to look at what you got. Are there any Bugs? Do they need
                | to be fixed? Is there anything that I can do better? Is it so
                | easy to use that even a Neanderthal can use it? Not every bug
                | needs to be fixed right now, due to the time constraint create a
                | reminder, and come back to it later. Focus on only fixing bugs
                | that would regularly impact the user, i.e., error messages that
                | don't go away, graphics that are conditional showing when their
                | condition is false, or any app breaking bugs.
